            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 21, 2014 by <a href="https://twitter.com/strickland">Matthew Strickland</a></p>

            <p>First of all, thank you to everyone who has supported Gitty since its 1.0 release in 2013.  Without your support and enthusiam, none of what I am announcing today would have been possible.</p>
            <p>With that said, I am excited to announce that Gitty 2 is nearing completion and will be available on the App Store for purchase in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>Gitty 2 has been rebuilt from the ground up to bring you everything you love about GitHub right to your iOS Device.  All of the features you love in Gitty are there but they have been dramatically improved.  Here are a few features that you can expect in Gitty 2:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Unified Activity Feed to see what is going on across all of your organizations. </li>
              <li>Multiple Account Support including GitHub for Enterprise. </li>
              <li>Rich Issue and Pull Request Support. Filtering and Sorting. Fully rendered Markdown support. Create, Edit, Open, Close, Merge, it's all there. </li>
              <li>Rich profile support for Repositories and Users. </li>
              <li>Discover Repositories and Users with updated Search and Trending features. </li>
              <li>Notification inbox that alerts you when new activity has happened. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the original release of Gitty, I felt like the bar was set high.  Since then there have been some other apps that were released and updated that reset that bar.  It is my hope that with Gitty 2, the bar will be set again.</p>
            <p>Please take a look at some of the screenshots below and watch a few videos to get an idea of what is to come.  Once Gitty 2 is available in the App Store</p>
